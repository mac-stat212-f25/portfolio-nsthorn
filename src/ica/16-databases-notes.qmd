## Introduction

If you find yourself analyzing data within a medium or large organization, you will probably draw on data stored within a centralized [data warehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse).


Data warehouses contain vast collections of information--far more than a desktop or laptop computer can easily analyze. 

These warehouses typically rely on structured data repositories called **relational databases** (also often called **SQL databases**).


Relational databases store data in **tables**, which are structured with rows and columns (attributes). Tables can be joined using **keys** which uniquely identify a row within a table.


## Connecting to a database in R with `DBI`

The `DBI` package (**d**ata**b**ase **i**nterface) provides general tools for interacting with databases from R. 

- It is also common for data scientists to interact with databases directly by writing SQL queries. We'll talk about this in the next section.


For now, we'll use `DBI` to connect with an **in-process** database (`duckdb`), one that runs locally on your computer. 

- A nice feature of `duckdb` is that even if your dataset is huge, `duckdb` can work with it very quickly.


We can set up a database connection with `dbConnect()` and initialize a temporary database with `duckdb()`:

```{r}
con <- DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb())
class(con)
```


In a real project, we would use `duckdb_read_csv()` to store data directly into the `duckdb` database without first having to read it into R. 

In the toy example below, we have a dataset on Spotify songs (`all_spotify_songs.csv`) and store in a database table called `"songs"`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
duckdb_read_csv(con, "songs", "https://hash-mac.github.io/stat212site-f25/relative/path/to/all_spotify_songs.csv")
```


Here, we'll use datasets from the `nycflights13` package. 

The `DBI` package provides the `dbWriteTable()` function to write dataset objects (in constrast to csv files) to a database:

```{r}
dbWriteTable(con, "flights", nycflights13::flights)
dbWriteTable(con, "planes", nycflights13::planes)
```

We can use `tbl()`, short for table, to create connections individually to the `flights` and `planes` datasets.

```{r}
flights <- tbl(con, "flights")
planes <- tbl(con, "planes")
```


Note that the results of `tbl()` are not quite the same as our normal data frames. 

Although they have class `tbl`, note that the number of rows is `NA`! 


The full dataset isn't loaded into memory when we use `tbl`, so the number of rows is unknown. This behavior is purposeful--it reduces computer resources and allows access to parts of the data only when needed.

```{r}
class(flights)
dim(flights)
```


## What is SQL? 

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. 

It is a programming language to query or retrieve data from a relational database. 


## SQL with `dplyr`

A really nice feature of `dplyr` is that we can write R code for wrangling the data and use `show_query()` to translate that code into SQL.

```{r}
flights |>
    show_query()

flights |>
    mutate(full_date = str_c(year, month, day, sep = "-")) |>
    show_query()
```


**Explore:** Create a Google Document and share it with the people at your table. Using the code examples below, work with your group to co-create a `dplyr`<-> SQL translation guide (notes document) that allows you to answer the following:

- What do `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY` in SQL do? (These uppercase words are called **clauses** in SQL.) 
  - How do these clauses translate to the main `tidyverse` verbs `select`, `mutate`, `filter`, `arrange`, `summarize`, `group_by`?
- What syntax differences are there for logical comparisons? 
  - How do the `&` and `|` logical operators in R compare to SQL?
- How does the R syntax for `mutate` translate to SQL?
- How does joining datasets seem to work in SQL?



```{r}
flights |> 
    filter(dest == "IAH") |> 
    arrange(dep_delay) |> 
    show_query()

flights |> 
    filter(dest == "IAH") |> 
    arrange(dep_delay) |> 
    head(n = 10) |> 
    show_query()

flights |> 
    filter(dest == "IAH" & origin == "JFK") |> 
    arrange(dep_delay) |> 
    show_query()

flights |> 
    filter(dest == "IAH" | origin == "JFK") |> 
    arrange(year, month, day, desc(dep_delay)) |> 
    show_query()
```

```{r}
flights |> 
    filter(dest %in% c("IAH", "HOU")) |> 
    show_query()

flights |> 
    filter(!is.na(dep_delay)) |> 
    show_query()
```

```{r}
planes |> 
    select(tailnum, type, manufacturer, model, year) |> 
    show_query()

planes |> 
    select(tailnum, type, manufacturer, model, year) |> 
    rename(year_built = year) |> 
    show_query()
```

```{r}
flights |> 
    mutate(
        speed = distance / (air_time / 60)
    ) |> 
    show_query()
```

```{r}
flights |> 
    left_join(planes, by = "tailnum") |> 
    show_query()
```



## SQL Practice

### Stack Exchange Data Explorer 

We will experiment with the [Stack Exchange Data Explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com/), a website that provides a SQL interface for all the data in StackExchange. 

StackExchange powers the StackOverflow programming question and answer site, but it also powers question and answer sites related to [126 topics](https://stackexchange.com/sites?view=grid) including [English](https://english.stackexchange.com/), [Travel](https://travel.stackexchange.com/), [Bicycles](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/), and [Parenting](https://parenting.stackexchange.com/). 

StackExchange provides an in-depth [Data Explorer Tutorial](https://data.stackexchange.com/help). We start with this interface to construct SQL queries on the [Travel Data Explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com/travel/queries).


### Instructions 

Head to the [Stack Exchange Data Explorer for Travel](https://data.stackexchange.com/travel/queries). 


You will see a list of queries other users have created in the past. These queries are for all Stack Exchange sites, so some may not be relevant. Queries about *your* activity (for example, "How many upvotes do I have for each tag?") will not be useful either if you do not have activity for the particular site. 


Click on one of them and you see the SQL code for the query. 

Then click the "Run Query" button to get results. 

For example, you might look at the number of [up vs down votes for questions and answers by weekday](https://data.stackexchange.com/travel/query/1718/up-vs-down-votes-by-day-of-week-of-question-or-answer) and notice that for questions, Tuesday has the highest up vs. down vote ratio and Saturday has the lowest. You can contemplate hypotheses for this difference!


### Select Queries 

Let's experiment with our own queries. 

Click on "Compose Query" in the upper right, and notice the tables are shown in the right. 

As a reminder, a table is similar to a data frame. 

- Each table lists the columns stored within the table and the data types for the columns. 
- Look through the tables for Posts, Users, and Comments. 
- Do the columns generally make sense, and correspond to the StackOverflow website? 


There's a  [description of the tables and columns](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/2678) (called a schema) available on StackExchange's Meta Q&A Site. 

Now enter your first query in the text box and click the "Run Query" button:

```{sql eval=FALSE}
SELECT TOP(100) Id, Title, Score, Body, Tags
FROM Posts
```

In this query we already see several important features of SQL:

- `SELECT` tells SQL that a query is coming.
- `TOP(100)` only returns the first 100 rows.
    - Note: The StackExchange data explorer uses a variant of SQL called [Transact SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transact-SQL) that is supported by Microsoft databases. `TOP(100)` is a non-standard SQL feature supported by T-SQL. For most databases you would accomplish the same goal by adding `LIMIT 100` to the end of the query.
- `Id, Title, Score, Body, Tags` determines what columns are included in the result
- `FROM Posts` determines the source dataset.


From glancing at the results, it appears that this table contains both questions and answers. 

Let's try to focus on answers. 

Looking again at the [Schema Description](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/2678), notice that there is a `PostTypeId` column in `Posts`, and a value of `1` corresponds to questions. 

Let's update our query to only include questions:

```{sql eval=FALSE}
SELECT TOP(100)
Id, Title, Score, Body, Tags
FROM Posts
WHERE PostTypeId = 1
```

The SQL command `WHERE` is like the `filter` command we have been using in `dplyr`.

- Note that whereas we used the double equals `==` for comparison in `R`, the SQL `WHERE` command takes just a single `=`.

**Exercise:** Find the title and score of Posts that have a score of at least 110. *Hint: TOP is not necessary here because you want all result rows.*

```{sql eval=FALSE}
SELECT 
Title, Score 
FROM Posts 
WHERE SCORE >= 110
```

**Exercise:** Find posts whose title contains some place you are interested in (you pick!). *Hint: use SQL's [LIKE operator](http://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-like/).*


```{sql eval=FALSE}
SELECT
Title
FROM Posts
WHERE Title LIKE '%Berlin%'
```


Note that you can look up the actual webpage for any question using its `Id`. 

For example, if the `Id` is 19591, the webpage [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) would be <https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/19591/>. Look up a few of the questions by their `Id`. 

It's unclear how the 100 questions we saw were selected from among the over 43,000 total questions.

- To count the number of posts, we can use `COUNT` in SQL: `SELECT COUNT(Id) FROM Posts Where PostTypeId = 1`.


Let's try to arrange the Posts by score. 


```{sql eval=FALSE}
SELECT TOP(100)
Id, Title, Score, Body, Tags
FROM Posts
WHERE PostTypeId = 1
ORDER BY Score DESC
```

The `ORDER BY ??? DESC` syntax is similar to R's `arrange()`. You can leave off the `DESC` if you want the results ordered smallest to largest.


We could also find the [highest rated questions tagged "italy"](https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/italy):

```{sql eval=FALSE}
SELECT TOP(100)
Id, Title, Score, Body, Tags
FROM Posts
WHERE PostTypeId = 1 AND Tags LIKE '%italy%'
ORDER BY Score DESC
```


**Exercise:** Pick two tags that interest you and you think will occur together and find the top voted posts that contain both.


```{sql eval=FALSE}
SELECT TOP(1)
Id, Title, Score, Body, Tags
FROM Posts
WHERE Tags LIKE '%germany%' AND Tags LIKE '%walking%' 
ORDER BY Score DESC
```


### SQL Summarization 

So far, we have covered the equivalent of R's selecting, filtering, and arranging. 

Let's take a look at grouping and summarizing now, which has similar structures in both `R` and SQL. Imagine we want to see how many posts of each type there are. This query shows us that there are 44K questions and 71K answers.

```{sql eval=FALSE}
SELECT 
PostTypeId, COUNT(Id) numPosts
FROM posts
GROUP BY PostTypeId 
ORDER BY PostTypeId
```

Note two characteristics of SQL summarization here:

- The `GROUP BY`clause indicates the table column for grouping, much like R's `group_by`.
- There is no explicit `summarize`. Instead, all columns that appear in the SELECT except for those listed in `GROUP BY` must make use of an aggregate function. `COUNT(*)` is one of these, and is the equivalent of R's `n()`. Many other [aggregate functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/aggregate-functions-transact-sql) exist, including `MAX`, `SUM`, `AVG`, and many others. Every aggregate function requires a column as an argument (even `COUNT()` which doesn't logically need one).
- The aggregate column (in this case `COUNT(Id)`) must immediately be followed by a name that will be used for it in the results (in this case `numPosts`). This can be particularly useful if you want to order by the aggregated value.

**Exercise:** Change the previous query so it orders the result rows by the number of posts of that type. *Hint: Reuse the name you assigned to the aggregate function.*

```{sql eval=FALSE}
SELECT 
PostTypeId, COUNT(Id) numPosts
FROM posts
GROUP BY PostTypeId 
ORDER BY numPosts
```


**Exercise:** Find the most commonly used tagsets (sets/combinations of tags) applied to posts. Note that this is not asking you to count the most common individual tags --- this would be more complex because multiple tags are squashed into the Tags field.


```{sql eval=FALSE}
SELECT 
Tags, COUNT(Tags) numTags
FROM posts
GROUP BY Tags 
ORDER BY numTags
```


### SQL Joins 

Finally, as with `R`, we often want to join data from two or more tables. The types of joins in SQL are the same as we saw with R (inner, outer, left, right). Most commonly we want to perform an INNER join, which is the default if you just say `JOIN`. (We can look up the `inner_join()` documentation to remind ourselves what an inner join does.)

Let's say we wanted to enhance the earlier query to find the highest scoring answers with some information about each user. 

```{sql eval=FALSE}
SELECT TOP(100)
Title, Score, DisplayName, Reputation
FROM Posts p
JOIN Users u
ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id
WHERE PostTypeId = 1
ORDER BY Score Desc
```

We see a few notable items here:

- The `JOIN` keyword must go in between the two tables we want to join.
- Each table must be named. In this case we named posts `p` and users `u`.
- We need to specify the relationship that joins the two tables. In this case, a posts `OwnerUserId` column refers to the `Id` column in the users table.

**Exercise:** Create a query similar to the one above that identifies the authors of the top rated comments instead of posts.
