title: "18 Interactive Viz"
---

## 🧩 Learning Goals

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:
- Evaluate when it would be useful to use an interactive visualization or an animation and when it might not be necessary
- Construct interactive visualizations and animations with `plotly`
- Build a Shiny app that enables user to adjust visualization choices and explore linked visualizations


```{r setup_18, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Background

The goal of interactivity should be to allow users to **explore data more quickly and/or more deeply than is possible with static data representations**.

### Pros

- Users can click, hover, zoom, and pan to get more detailed information
- Users can get quickly and deeply explore the data via linked data representations
- Allows guided exploration of results without needing to share data


### Cons

- Takes longer to design
- Analyst might spend longer exploring an interactive visualization than a series of static visualizations
- Poor design could result in information overload


### Features

Common features of interactive visualizations^[Andrienko, N., Andrienko, G., Fuchs, G., Slingsby, A., Turkay, C., Wrobel, S. (2020). Principles of Interactive Visualisation. In: Visual Analytics for Data Scientists. Springer, Cham. <https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-56146-8_3>] include:


- Changing data representation: providing options to change the type of plot displayed (e.g., allowing users to visualize temperature patterns over a month vs. over years)
- Focusing and getting details: mousing over part of a visualization to see an exact data value, zooming and panning
- Data transformation: e.g., changing color scale, switching to/from log scale
- Data selection and filtering: highlighting and brushing regions of a plot to focus the selected points; reordering and filtering data show in tables
- Finding corresponding information in multiple views: linked views that update dynamically based on interaction in another plot (often by zooming, panning, or selecting certain points)



## Motivating Example

Kyle Walker's [neighborhood diversity interactive application](https://walkerke.shinyapps.io/neighborhood_diversity/) allows exploration of neighborhood diversity across time and space. It showcases major packages and features of interactive visualization. We will recreate the core parts of this app from scratch.



### App Exploration

To avoid overloading the author's Shiny server, **only one** person from each table group should open the app and navigate around. Then, as a group

1. Catalog the app's **layout** and **interactivity features** and make note of where user inputs are located and how different parts of the app respond to user input.
2. Evaluate the design of this app.
    - Is the interactivity in this app needed, ie, does the interactivity actually help you gain more insight and perhaps more quickly than a series of static visualizations?
    - What explorations/comparisons are you curious to explore that are not enabled well by the app?


In case the app doesn't load, use the following screenshots:

## Shiny

Shiny facilitates building interactive web applications using R code without needing extensive knowledge of web coding technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

### Setup 

The neighborhood diversity app was made with the Shiny toolkit available in the `shiny` R package. 


Download and leave open the [Shiny cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/shiny.pdf).


Let's look at an example app together. RStudio will create a template app when you go to **File** --> **New File** --> **Shiny Web App** then enter/select the following values: 

- for the **Application name**, type `neighborhood_diversity`.
- for **Application type**, leave the default option **Single file (app.R)**

This creates a folder in your current directory called `neighborhood_diversity` with a single R code file called `app.R`.


Click the Run App button in the top right of the source code editor to view the app in action.

The `app.R` has three components:

- a user interface object (`ui`): to set up the layout of the app
- a server function (`server`): to define how the app will react to user input
- a call to the `shinyApp()` function: to launch the app using the UI object (`ui`) and server function (`server`) created above

### Getting Acquainted

**Setup part 1:** Load required packages at the top of `app.R`: `shiny`, `tidyverse`, `sf`, and `plotly`.

**Setup part 2:** Data download and folder setup

Save the two files, [diverse_data_by_dist.rds](https://mac-stat.github.io/data/diverse_data_by_dist.rds) and [diverse_data_by_year.csv](https://mac-stat.github.io/data/diverse_data_by_year.csv), with the folder setup below inside your portfolio repository.

- 📂 `neighborhood_diversity`
    - `app.R`
    - 📂 `data`
        - `diverse_data_by_dist.rds`
        - `diverse_data_by_year.csv`

**Setup part 3:** Below your `library()` calls, add the following commands to read in the data:

```{r reading}
#| eval: false
data_by_dist <- read_rds("relative path to diverse_data_by_dist.rds")
data_by_year <- read_csv("relative path to diverse_data_by_year.csv")
```

**Getting acquainted with the app and underlying code:** Take a few minutes to explore the code:

- `ui` section. How are functions nested inside each other, and how does this seem to relate to the visual appearance of the app?
- What names/labels in the User Interface (`ui`) part of the app seem to be shared with the `server` part of the app?


### Data Codebook

The `data_by_dist` dataset is an `sf` object (cases = census tracts) with the following variables:

- `metro_id`: numeric ID for the city
- `metro_name`: city name
- `geometry`: information about the spatial geometry for the tract
- `tract_id`: numeric census tract ID
- `distmiles`: distance in miles from this tract to city hall
- `entropy`: a measure of the diversity of a census tract (a diversity "score")
- Race variables (each of these is the number of people)
    - `aian`: American Indian
    - `asian`
    - `black`
    - `hispanic`
    - `two_or_more`
    - `white`

The `data_by_year` dataset has a subset of the above variables as well as a `year` variable.


### `*Input()` functions 

**What do these do?** The `*Input()` functions collect inputs from the user.


**Where are these functions on the cheatsheet?** Right-hand side of the first page


**Where do these go in the app?**

- All `*Input()` functions go in the `ui` part of the app.
- Pay careful attention to the nesting of the functions in the `ui` section. For example, in a `sidebarLayout()`, these `*Input()` functions should go in the `sidebarPanel()` (as opposed to the `mainPanel()`).
- Separate multiple `*Input()` functions with commas.


**How do the function arguments work?** In all the `*Input()` functions, the first two arguments are the same:

- `inputId` is how you will refer to this input in the `server` portion later. *You can call this anything you want*, but make this ID describe the information that the user is providing.
- `label` is how this will actually be labeled in your UI (what text shows up in the app).

Each function has some additional arguments depending what you want to do.



**Your Turn**

Add the following two user inputs to your app:

- Dropdown to select the city name
- Slider to choose the span parameter for the scatterplot smooth
    - This parameter varies from 0 to 1. Lower values result in a wiggly smoothing line, and higher values result in a smoother line.

Use the Shiny cheatsheet to find the `*Input()` functions that correspond to the two inputs above. Add them to the appropriate place within the `ui` object. Use commas to separate the inputs.

::: {.callout-tip title="Parentheses Pandemonium"}
Carefully formatting your code will be crucial here! With `shiny` UIs, it is very easy to lose or mismatch parentheses, which leads to frustrating errors. My suggestion is to place parentheses as follow:

```
sliderInput(
    argument1 = value1,
    argument2 = value2,
    argument3 = value3
)
```

Note how the left parenthesis is on the same line as the function, and the right parenthesis is on its own line and left-aligned with the start of the function name.

Tip: In RStudio, you can place your cursor next to any parenthesis to highlight the matching parenthesis (if there is one).
:::

You will have to look at the **documentation** for the `*Input()` functions to know how to use arguments beyond `inputId` and `label`. To view this documentation, type `?function_name` in the Console.

To get the collection of city names from the `data_by_dist` dataset, you can use the following:

```r
metro_names <- data_by_dist |> pull(metro_name) |> unique()
```

Put this `metro_names` code just beneath where you read in the data.

Once you finish, run your app. Make sure you can select and move things around as expected. You won't see any plots yet---we'll work on those in the next exercises.


### `*Output()` functions 


**What do these do?** `*Output()` functions in the `ui` portion work with the `render*()` functions in the server portion to to add R output (like plots and tables) to the UI.


**Where are these functions on the cheatsheet?** Bottom-center of the first page


**Where do these go in the app?**

- All `*Output()` functions go in the `ui` part of the app.
- Pay careful attention to the nesting of the functions in the `ui` section. For example, in a `sidebarLayout()`, these `*Output()` functions should go in the `mainPanel()` (as opposed to the `sidebarPanel()`).
- Separate multiple `*Output()` functions with commas.


**How do the function arguments work?** In all the `*Output()` functions, the first argument is the same:

- `outputId` works just like `inputId` for `*Input()` functions. This is how you will refer to this output in the `server` portion later. *You can call this anything you want*, but make this ID describe the output being created.



**Your Turn**

Add 3 outputs to the `ui` that will eventually be:

- A scatterplot of diversity score (`entropy`) versus distance to city hall (`distmiles`) with a smoothing line (smoothness controlled by the span parameter on your slider input)
- A map of diversity scores across the counties in the selected city
- A bar chart of the overall race distribution in the selected city (i.e., the total number of people in each race category in the city)

For now, don't worry that the layout of the plots exactly matches the original neighborhood diversity app. (You will update this in your homework.)

Run the app with the output. Notice that nothing really changes. Think of the outputs you just placed as placeholders---the app knows there will be a plot in the UI, but the details of what the plots will look like and the R code to create them will be in the `server` portion. Let’s talk about that now!


### `render*()` functions


**What do these do?** The `render*()` functions use R code (i.e., standard `ggplot` code) to communicate with ("listen to") the user inputs to create the desired output.



**Where are these functions on the cheatsheet?** Bottom-center of the first page. The `render*()` function you use will depend on the desired output. The bottom center of the cheatsheet shows how `*Output()` and `render*()` functions connect.


**Where do these go in the app?** The `render*()` functions go in the `server` function of the app. 


In general, the server section of code will look something like this:

```{r shiny_server_example, eval=FALSE}
# Suppose the following are somewhere in the UI part
numericInput(inputId = "min_year")
numericInput(inputId = "max_year")
plotOutput(outputId = "plot_over_years")

server <- function(input, output) {
    output$plot_over_years <- renderPlot({ # Note the curly braces that enclose the R code below
        ggplot(...) +
            scale_x_continuous(limits = c(input$min_year, input$max_year))
    })
}
```


**Your Turn**

While our main goals is to make 3 plots, you will just make one of them in this exercise.

Add a `renderPlot()` functions inside the `server` portion of the code to make the scatterplot of diversity score (`entropy`) versus distance to city hall (`distmiles`) with a smoothing line. Use the `data_by_dist` dataset. Reference the inputs you’ve already created in previous exercises by using `filter()` and `ggplot()` to render the desired interactive plot.

*Note:* the `geom_???` used to create the smoothing line has a `span` parameter. (Check out the documentation for that geom by entering `?geom_???` in the Console.)

Run the app and check that the scatterplot displays and reacts to the chosen city and span parameter.


As part of [Homework 9](https://hash-mac.github.io/stat212site-f25/homeworks/homework9.html), you will finish this Shiny app.



## `plotly` package

The `plotly` package provides tools for creating interactive web graphics and is a nice complement to Shiny. 

### Getting Started {.unnumbered .smaller }

```{r load_plotly}
library(plotly)
```

A wonderful feature of `plotly` is that an interactive graphic can be constructed by taking a regular `ggplot` graph and putting it inside the `ggplotly()` function:

```{r plotly_static_example}
data(babynames, package = "babynames")
bnames <- babynames |> filter(name %in% c("Brianna", "Briana", "Breanna"))

p <- ggplot(bnames, aes(x = year, y = prop, color = sex, linetype = name)) +
    geom_line() +
    theme_classic() +
    labs(x = "Year", y = "Proportion of names", color = "Gender", linetype = "Name")

ggplotly(p)
```

The `plotly` package can also create animations by incorporating `frame` and `ids` aesthetics.

- `frame = year`: This makes the frame of the animation correspond to year--so the animation shows changes across time (years).
- `ids = country`: This ensures smooth transitions between objects with the same `id` (which helps facilitate object constancy throughout the animation). Here, each point is a country, so this makes the animation transition smoothly from year to year for a given country. (For more information, see [here](https://plotly-r.com/animating-views).)

```{r plotly_animation_example}
data(gapminder, package = "gapminder")
p <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop)) +
    geom_point(aes(frame = year, ids = country)) +
    scale_x_log10() +
    labs(x = "GDP per capita", y = "Life expectancy (years)", color = "Continent", size = "Population") +
    theme_classic()
ggplotly(p)
```


**Your Turn**

In a web application, having plots be `plotly` objects is just nice by default because of the great mouseover, zoom, and pan features. 

Inside `app.R`, change `plotOutput` to `plotlyOutput` and `renderPlot` to `renderPlotly` for the scatterplot and the barplot. Make sure to add calls to `ggplotly()` too.


As part of Homework 9, you will incorporate advanced `plotly` into the Shiny App.


## Publishing Shiny apps

To share your work publicly, you'll need to publish your Shiny app.

### Shinyapps.io

The steps below take you through publishing via [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/).

The first step is to install and load the `rsconnect` library.

You will be able to share your app with any individual with internet access unless you make it password-protected.

1. Register for an account at <https://www.shinyapps.io/admin/#/signup>.
2. Once you are logged in to shinyapps.io, go to Account –> Tokens and click the Show button.
3. Copy and paste the code into the Console in R. This will connect your account to RStudio.
4. When you create an app, save it as `app.R` in a folder. It **MUST** be named `app.R`. In the `app.R` file, load all packages you use in your code. Try not to load extra packages---this can make publishing take longer and slow down the app for users. Any data that your app uses needs to be read in within the app. If the data are local to your computer, you need to have the data in the same folder as the app.
5. Run the app. In the upper right-hand corner, there is an option to publish the app. Click on that. It will take a bit of time to do it the first time. Once published, you can go to the app via the webpage provided.

The instructions are set out in more detail [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html).
